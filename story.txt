Long time ago, there was a boy called Eddie. He lived in a village in a 
 moutain with his wife and parents. There was a devil also living in the 
mountain and one day that devil took Eddie's children as his dinner. 
Then Eddie decided to rescue his children with all costsi.

Therefore, Eddie started his venture to find the devil.He walked through 
the forest, but he heard some scary sound around the forest. Suddenly, a 
Goblin showed up and scared Eddie. He had no choice but ran away. 

After Eddie ran and ran through the forest for a few minutes, jumping over
logs and rocks, he stopped to catch his breath. The sun was setting and it
was getting dark in the forest, and Eddie was all alone. He decided to go
home, he would go back to find the devil and his stolen children the next day.
As Eddie started walking through the forest once again, he heard a devilish 
laugh not far away.

Eddie hides behind a close rock. Behind the rock there is a sword and a suit of 
armor. "What great fortune I have!" he said aloud. Eddie put the armor on and took
the sword, ready to face the devil. He ran straight towards the laugh, and did not
look back. 

When he approached that laugh, he found out that the devil is sitting by the dinner
table with his children sitting beside him eating salads on the table. Eddie 
thinks "what is going on here? Isn't this devil going to eat my children?" 
The devil seems to read his face and explained that "I never wanted to eat your
children. I just want someone to talk with me and bring me laugh. Your kids are
sunny and not afraid my scary face. We are good friends." The children also 
appologize to their father for leaving without telling him. After this Eddie
and the devil becomes close friends and people in the village are not afraid of
that devil anymore.
