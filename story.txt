Long time ago, there is a boy called Eddie. He lives in a village in a 
 moutain with his wife and parents. There is a devil also living in the 
mountain and one day that devil took Eddie's children as his dinner. 
Then Eddie decided to rescue his children with all costsi.

Therefore, Eddie started his venture to find the devil.He walked through 
the forest, but he heard some scary sound around the forest. Suddenly, a 
Goblin showed up and scared Eddie. He had no choice but ran away. 

After Eddie ran and ran through the forest for a few minutes, jumping over
logs and rocks, he stopped to catch his breath. The sun was setting and it
was getting dark in the forest, and Eddie was all alone. He decided to go
home, he would go back to find the devil and his stolen children the next day.
As Eddie started walking through the forest once again, he heard a devilish 
laugh not far away.
